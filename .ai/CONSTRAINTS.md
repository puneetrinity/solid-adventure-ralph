# Constraints
- Railway hosting
- NestJS + BullMQ (Redis) + Prisma (Postgres)
- Multi-repo support (single user)
- "Patch proposals until approved" safety posture
- Orchestrator decides state; LLM cannot transition states
- Evidence-first: Proof Ledger stores context hash + artifacts + gate results + approval records
- CI execution via GitHub Actions only
